This is my first project in the Odin Project course. I have prior HTML and CSS experience. Not too much but I am comfortable with the syntax and many concepts.
This will be a great refresher and test of knowledge.
I am super excited to continue learning 
Using this project to learn Git and the importance of valuable Commit messages.

EDIT: Not going to use any CSS on this project. I will come back to it later after the Odin Project teaches me more CSS.

Assignment:

within odin-recipes, create index.html file
Fill it out with the usual boilerplate, add an H1 heading "Odin Recipes"

within odin-recipes, create a new directory and name it recipes

create a new HTML file within recipes directory. Name it after the recipe it will contain. I.E. lasagna.html
Make sure to include the boilerplate in every html file.
For now just include an H1 heading with the recipes name  as its content. 

Back in index.html, add a link to the recipe page you created. 
Example: Under the <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> heading, write out the link so: <a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>. Text of link should be recipe name. 

Add a link back to the index page. 


ITERATION 3

Your new recipe page should have the following:

An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that was added previously
Under the image it should have an appropriately sized "description" heading followed by paragraph or two describing the recipe. 
Under the description, add an "ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "steps" heading followed by an Ordered List of the steps needed for making the dish. 

ITERATION 4 add more recipes

Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipes page previously created
Remember to link the new recipes on the index page. Consider putting links in an unordered list so they aren't all on one line.
